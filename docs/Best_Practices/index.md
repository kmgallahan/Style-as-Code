A goal of this project is to provide a place to learn about and discuss code style best practices. After all, if an EditorConfig file suggests that you write code in a certain way, you'll probably want to know why.

To that end, this repository provides the following information for a variety of code style subjects:

* Recommendation
* Justification
* Arguments
* Exceptions
* Performance
* Readability
* Analyzers
* Discussion

This information is presented through markdown pages with associated GitHub issues for discussion. Each page focuses on a code style topic that might apply to multiple EditorConfig rules and Roslyn Analyzers.
