Style as Code helps C# developers write code with consistent style.

This is done by expanding the use of [EditorConfig](EditorConfigs/index.md) files and [Rosyln Analyzers](faq.md).

## What you get here

This project provides 3 things to help developers get started with EditorConfigs:

* [Guidance](EditorConfigs/index.md) on EditorConfig files
* Information about code style [best practices](Best_Practices/index.md)
* [A process](resolving_violations.md) for implementing codebase changes

## Why you should care

The goals are:

* Consistent code style across projects
* Less pain from code style related changes
* A place to learn about and discuss code style best practices
* Less time spent creating and maintaining EditorConfig files
* Less distraction from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of IDE suggestions and warnings
