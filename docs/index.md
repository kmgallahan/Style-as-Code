Style as Code helps developers produce code with a consistent style.

This is accomplished by spreading awareness and use of [EditorConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options) files. In a nutshell:

> You can add an EditorConfig file to your project or codebase to enforce consistent coding styles for everyone that works in the codebase. EditorConfig settings take precedence over global Visual Studio text editor settings.

To help do this, this project provides 3 things:

* A well thought out EditorConfig file
* A process for implementing codebase changes
* A collection of information about code style best practices

The goals are:

* More consistent code style across projects
* Lower burden of implementing code style related changes
* A place learn about and discuss code style best practices
* Less time spent creating and maintaining EditorConfig files
* Less distraction from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of IDE suggestions
