Style as Code helps C# developers write code with consistent style.

This is done by expanding the use of [EditorConfig](The_EditorConfig/index.md) files and [Rosyln Analyzers](https://styleascode.net/Style_as_Code/FAQ.html#q-what-are-roslyn-analyzers).

## What you get here

This project provides 3 things to help developers get started with EditorConfigs :

* A practical [EditorConfig file](../The_EditorConfig/index.md)
* Information about code style [best practices](../The_Best_Practices/index.md)
* [Processes](../The_Process/index.md) for implementing codebase changes

## Why you should care

The goals are:

* Consistent code style across projects
* Less pain from code style related changes
* A place to learn about and discuss code style best practices
* Less time spent creating and maintaining EditorConfig files
* Less distraction from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of IDE suggestions and warnings
