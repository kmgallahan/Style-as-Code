Style as Code helps developers produce code with consistent style.

This is accomplished by encouraging the use of [EditorConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options) files. In a nutshell:

> You can add an EditorConfig file to your project or codebase to enforce consistent coding styles for everyone that works in the codebase. EditorConfig settings take precedence over global Visual Studio text editor settings.

## What you get here

This project provides 3 things to help developers get started with EditorConfigs :

* A practical EditorConfig file to use
* Processes for implementing codebase changes
* Information about code style best practices

## Why you should care

The goals are:

* Consistent code style across projects
* Less pain from code style related changes
* A place learn about and discuss code style best practices
* Less time spent creating and maintaining EditorConfig files
* Less distraction from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of IDE suggestions
