# Style as Code

Style as Code helps developers produce code with a consistent style.

For more information see the [GitHub Pages site](https://kmgallahan.github.io/Style-as-Code), or browse [the docs](https://github.com/kmgallahan/Style-as-Code/tree/master/docs) here.

## Contributing to the docs

The Style as Code site is generated from a collection of markdown files. The root can be found [here](docs/).

The pages live in folders that correspond to the top-level items of the navigation menu. Parent & grandparent relationships are maintained using the corresponding [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) titles.

None of the markdown is currently generated by any tools, so feel free to contribute changes. The site is built on any commits to master.

Most of the docs are created and maintained using Visual Studio Code with these markdown-related extensions:

* [Github Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview)
* [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
* [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

## Contributing to the site

The Style as Code site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It gets statically generated using a [fork](https://github.com/kmgallahan/just-the-docs) of [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs), a Jekyll theme.

The fork exists mainly to apply css styling, with minor HTML & [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) tweaks.

The site is meant to share information in a distraction free environment, so bells and whistles are kept ot a minimum.
